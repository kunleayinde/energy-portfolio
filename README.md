# 🏠 Residential Energy Use Analysis (RECS 2009)

This project analyzes U.S. household energy consumption patterns based on the 2009 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) dataset. It focuses on how **climate zones** and **housing types** influence **space heating and cooling energy use** across U.S. regions.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Northeast & Midwest**: Highest space heating loads (40–60% of total energy).
- **South**: Significant cooling demand (10–20%), especially in mobile homes.
- **Housing Type Matters**: Detached homes consume far more than apartments.

## 🧠 How to Use

1. Open the notebook:  
   You can use Jupyter, VS Code, or Google Colab.
   
2. Run the analysis:  
   Explore how energy use shifts with geography and building characteristics.

3. Customize it:  
   Extend with new datasets (e.g., 2015, 2020 RECS), or add factors like income, square footage, or occupancy.

## 🌱 Next Steps

- Add a machine learning model to predict total energy use
- Compare RECS 2009 with more recent years
- Simulate climate change impact on regional energy demands
